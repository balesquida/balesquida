### Hi Word!  It's me: Balesquida ðŸ‘‹

  I am passionate about **communication** and **accessibility**. 
  
  Specialised in the **creation** of content related with culture and institutional communication at the media as well as social media and web. 
  
  Previously I worked as **manager** of cultural projects both at a national and international level. 
  
  I have now redirected my career towards the **creation of _digital content_ and _web development_** to provide a broader experience.

  Willing to discover new paths and to continue learning.

  Eager to embark on new paths
