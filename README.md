### Hi World!  It's me: Balesquida ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about  **communication** and  **accessibility**.

Specialized in the  **creation** of content related to culture and institutional communication in the media as well as social media and the web.

Previously, I worked as a  **manager** of cultural projects both at a national and international level.

I have now redirected my career towards the **creation of _digital content_ and _web development_** to provide a broader experience.

Willing to discover new paths and to continue learning.

Eager to embark on new paths
